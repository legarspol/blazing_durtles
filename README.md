## Preparing to build the code

Before you can build this code, you will have to replace the existing two files containing identification
information for the app with your own versions. This is because the open source license covering this app's 
code does not cover the name I gave the app, and it also doesn't cover my name. See the file LICENSE.md for details.

- Remove any existing Indentification.java file from app/src/main/java/com.smouldering_durtles.wk
- Copy the file app/Identification.java.sample.txt to app/src/main/java/com.smouldering_durtles.wk
- Name the copy Identification.java
- Edit the file to supply your own identification for the app
- Remove any existing strings.xml file from app/src/res/values
- Copy the file app/strings.xml.sample.txt to app/src/main/res/values
- Name the copy strings.xml
- Edit the file to supply your own identification for the app

After this, you are ready to build the code.
